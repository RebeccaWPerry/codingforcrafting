# codingforcrafting
A list of projects using code for fiber art projects.

Examples of Using Coding for Fiber Arts Projects:
* Writing or modifying patterns
* Finding or selecting patterns
* Robotic handiwork (knitting machine, embroidery machine)
* Visualizing and rendering
* Modeling and simulating
